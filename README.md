# qb-practice

A live buzzer application built on PeerJS for quiz bowl. Host/reader has access to two iframes linked to quizbowlpackets.com which eliminate the need for switching windows. Additionally, when a player buzzes in, a sound effect plays and the iframes are obscured. Buzzer styling modeled on the popular "Officiator" by Anderson Buzzer Systems.
