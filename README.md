# qb-practice

A live buzzer application built on PeerJS for quiz bowl. 

Host/reader has access to two iframes linked to quizbowlpackets.com which eliminate the need for switching windows. When players buzz in, a sound effect rings and the iframes are obscured.

Buzzer styling modeled on the popular "Officiator" by Anderson Buzzer Systems.
